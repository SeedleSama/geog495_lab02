        The volcanic interior of Kilimanjaro is poorly known because there has not been any significant erosion to expose the igneous strata that comprise the volcano's structure.
        <br>
        <br>
        Eruptive activity at the Shira centre commenced about 2.5 million years ago, with the last important phase occurring about 1.9 million years ago, just before the northern part of the edifice collapsed. 
        Shira is topped by a broad plateau at 3,800 metres (12,500 ft), which may be a filled caldera. 
        The remnant caldera rim has been degraded deeply by erosion. 
        Before the caldera formed and erosion began, Shira might have been between 4,900 and 5,200 m (16,100 and 17,100 ft) high. 
        It is mostly composed of basic lavas, with some pyroclastics. 
        The formation of the caldera was accompanied by lava emanating from ring fractures, but there was no large scale explosive activity. 
        Two cones formed subsequently, the phonolitic one at the northwest end of the ridge and the doleritic Platzkegel in the caldera centre.

        Both Mawenzi and Kibo began erupting about 1 million years ago. 
        They are separated by the Saddle Plateau at 4,400 metres (14,400 ft) elevation.
        <br>
        <br>
        The youngest dated rocks at Mawenzi are about 448,000 years old. 
        Mawenzi forms a horseshoe-shaped ridge with pinnacles and ridges opening to the northeast, with a tower-like shape resulting from deep erosion and a mafic dike swarm. 
        Several large cirques cut into the ring. The largest of these sits on top of the Great Barranco gorge. 
        Also notable are the East and West Barrancos on the northeastern side of the mountain. 
        Most of the eastern side of the mountain has been removed by erosion. Mawenzi has a subsidiary peak, Neumann Tower, 4,425 metres (14,518 ft).
