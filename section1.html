        <b><i>Mount Kilimanjaro</i></b> is a dormant volcano in Tanzania. 
        It has three volcanic cones: Kibo, Mawenzi, and Shira. 
        It is the highest mountain in Africa and the highest single free-standing mountain above sea level in the world: 5,895 metres (19,341 ft) above sea level and about 4,900 metres (16,100 ft) above its plateau base. 
        It is the highest volcano in Africa and the Eastern Hemisphere.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b><i>Mount Kilimanjaro</i></b> is the fourth most topographically prominent peak on Earth. 
        It is part of Kilimanjaro National Park and is a major hiking and climbing destination.
        Because of its shrinking glaciers and ice fields, which are projected to disappear between 2025 and 2035, it has been the subject of many scientific studies.
        <br>
        <br>
        Kilimanjaro is a large dormant stratovolcano composed of three distinct volcanic cones: Kibo, the highest; Mawenzi at 5,149 metres (16,893 ft); and Shira, the lowest at 4,005 metres (13,140 ft). 
        Mawenzi and Shira are extinct, while Kibo is dormant and could erupt again.
        <br>
        <br>
        Uhuru Peak is the highest summit on Kibo's crater rim. 
        The Tanzania National Parks Authority, a Tanzanian government agency, and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization lists the height of Uhuru Peak as 5,895 m (19,341 ft), based on a British survey in 1952. 
        The height has since been measured as 5,892 metres (19,331 ft) in 1999, 5,902 metres (19,364 ft) in 2008, and 5,899 metres (19,354 ft) in 2014.
        <br>
        <br>
        A map of the Kibo cone on Mount Kilimanjaro was published by the British government's Directorate of Overseas Surveys (DOS) in 1964 based on aerial photography conducted in 1962 as the "Subset of Kilimanjaro, East Africa (Tanganyika) Series Y742, Sheet 56/2, D.O.S. 422 1964, Edition 1, Scale 1:50,000". 
        Tourist mapping was first published by the Ordnance Survey in England in 1989 based on the original DOS mapping at a scale of 1:100,000, with 100 feet (30 m) contour intervals, as DOS 522. West Col Productions produced a map with tourist information in 1990, at a scale of 1:75,000, with 100 metres (330 ft) contour intervals; it included inset maps of Kibo and Mawenzi on 1:20,000 and 1:30,000 scales respectively and with 50 metres (160 ft) contour intervals.
        In recent years, numerous other maps have become available, of various qualities.
