        Kibo's diminishing ice cap exists because Kilimanjaro is a little-dissected, massive mountain that rises above the snow line. 
        The cap is divergent and at the edges splits into individual glaciers. 
        The central portion of the ice cap is interrupted by the presence of the Kibo crater. 
        The summit glaciers and ice fields do not display significant horizontal movements because their low thickness precludes major deformation.

        Geological evidence shows five successive glacial episodes during the Quaternary period, namely First (500,000 BP), Second (greater than 360,000 years ago to 240,000 BP), Third (150,000 to 120,000 BP), Fourth (also known as "Main") (20,000 to 17,000 BP), and Little (16,000 to 14,000 BP). 
        The Third may have been the most extensive, and the Little appears to be statistically indistinguishable from the Fourth.

        A continuous ice cap covering approximately 400 square kilometres (150 sq mi) down to an elevation of 3,200 metres (10,500 ft) covered Kilimanjaro during the Last Glacial Maximum in the Pleistocene epoch (the Main glacial episode), extending across the summits of Kibo and Mawenzi. 
        Because of the exceptionally prolonged dry conditions during the subsequent Younger Dryas stadial, the ice fields on Kilimanjaro may have become extinct around 11,500 years BP. 
        Ice cores taken from Kilimanjaro's Northern Ice Field (NIF) indicates that the glaciers there have a basal age of about 11,700 years, although an analysis of ice taken in 2011 from exposed vertical cliffs in the NIF supports an age extending only to 800 years BP. 
        Higher precipitation rates at the beginning of the Holocene epoch (11,500 years BP) allowed the ice cap to reform. 
        The glaciers survived a widespread drought during a three century period beginning around 4,000 years BP.
